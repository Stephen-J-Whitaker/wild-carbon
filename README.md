# **Wild Carbon**
[‘Wild Carbon’]( https://wild-carbon-803b1e2f6e91.herokuapp.com/) is a website (hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and implemented with the aid of the Python Django framework) that’s for people who want to offset their carbon footprint and care about the environment.

Wild Carbon offers a service where users of the website can commission trees to be grown and planted on their behalf at Wild Carbon’s site in the west of Ireland. Once planted, the trees are allowed to grow in the protected, newly rewilded, site for the duration of the trees’ lives, gradually sequestering carbon for the people who commissioned them.

The company isn’t only about providing a carbon sequestration service,
. It’s also about rewilding, the return of areas that have been cultivated, perhaps for many years, to a wild state. This involves the planting of the commissioned native trees along with other flora that would have naturally inhabited the site. In turn, this replanting of the site encourages the return of the native fauna.

Sequestering carbon for the Wild Carbon customers whilst increasing the natural biodiversity of areas of land is the mission of Wild Carbon.
