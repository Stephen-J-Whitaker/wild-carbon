                ‘Wild Carbon’ is a company that can enable you to rewild your way to a carbon neutral or even carbon negative life! 

                We provide you with the opportunity to commission the growth and planting of trees of your choosing at our location in the west of Ireland.
    
                On placing your order with us, we begin the process of growing your selected trees. Once of the required maturity, these trees are then planted out onto our protected site and allowed to grow indefinitely, gradually sequestering carbon for you.

                Revisit soon when you’ll have the opportunity to sponsor a cubic meter of blanket bog. Blanket bog is currently being cut and used as fuel. By sponsoring the purchase of blanket bog you are contributing to the reflooding and restoration of the bog. 

                A cubic meter of blanket bog can release up to 385kg of CO2! By paying to preserve bog that would otherwise release carbon you could offset your life’s carbon by sponsoring just 37 meters squared of 2 meter deep blanket bog for €100!
